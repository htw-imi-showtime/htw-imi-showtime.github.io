With that information, we are creating a Map with the path and pictures youâ€™ve taken along your adventures outside.

The idea for our app originated out of a conversation with a local gardening project. It is an approach to a rather recent question: How do you make spending time in nature more appealing to children and adolescents who grew up on smartphones and other mobile devices?
Our supervisor, Prof. Dr. Lenz approached us with his initial idea for a mobile application which already laid out most of the core features that the final version of Strollr incorporates, like the ability to take photos and visualize walks with a map.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b3/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b3/tech-stack/</guid><description>Communication Discord During our time developing Strollr, Discord was the main hub for all our conversations, quick questions, short meetups as well as a medium for exchanging pictures and sharing links or useful information.
