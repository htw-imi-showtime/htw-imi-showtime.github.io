Because we liked the drag and drop functionality that was already provided in our code base and we wanted to be consistent with the usability of our application, we also implemented that for the course registration.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/process/</guid><description>Brainstorming feature ideas &amp;amp; prioritizing During the beginning of the project, we still had the chance to meet in person, which was really helpful when collecting all of our ideas. Our supervisors initial idea was to make the elective course registration for the IMI students easier, which can be accomplished in a variety of ways. This led us to a long period of time where we thought about different approaches and how realistic it is for us to achieve these.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/tech-stack/</guid><description>Developing Tools For the developing process, we used the &amp;ldquo;MEVN&amp;rdquo; stack, which consists of widely used and good documented tools to build a web application with HTML, CSS and Javascript. The tool that we worked the most with from this stack was Vue.js, since it is easy to learn and had the advantage of being reactive.
MongoDB
document based database Express.js
JavaScript web framework that extends Node.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/future/</guid><description>Continued in a bachelor thesis Just like we continued the work of Julia, our project is going to be continued to maybe add some of the features we came up with and improve the application even more. Extensions Our task was to make the elective course registration for IMI bachelor students easier. However, our final product can easily be extended.</description></item></channel></rss>
