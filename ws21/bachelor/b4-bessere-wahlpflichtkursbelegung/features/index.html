Because we liked the drag and drop functionality that was already provided in our code base and we wanted to be consistent with the usability of our application, we also implemented that for the course registration. The students can order their favourite courses into the different priorities. Here, the very first priority corresponds to the course they would like to attend the most. This should prevent students from trying to sign up for too many courses, to have a greater selection at the end, since this leads to occupied spots for other students, which perhaps are being wasted at the end.</p><h4 id=registration>Registration</h4><p>The <a href=https://www.htw-berlin.de/studium/studienorganisation/kursbelegung/>ranking system</a> provided by the HTW and the priority system we came up with are responsible for who gets asigned to which course. The students have to choose a specifically desired amount of courses they want to attend, which also prevents them from choosing too many courses, while it also tries to give them this exact amount. This means, that the priorities should be chosen very consciously, because you cant be asigned for more courses than what you have specified. The courses that are being put into a lower priority have a higher chance of going into the draw procedure. This happens, when there are less free spots than registrations in the specific rank. Currently, there is a <a href=https://studyplan.f4.htw-berlin.de>test run</a> live where all the IMI students who would want to attend elective courses can participate in.</p></div></section><figure><img src=/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/CourseSelection.png alt></figure></p><p><section><h3>Survey</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>After choosing your courses in either one of the phases, <strong>you have the chance to give reasons for why you have applied for each one of them</strong>. This is an optional feature though and not mandatory for the actual course registration. By showing which courses are more popular and why, this should also help professors to understand the students decision on the elective courses, which will also help to make future enrollments easier. There are five default options, that can be chosen by checkboxes and additionally you can also give a custom answer.</div></section><figure><img src=/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/Survey.png alt></figure></p><p><section><h3>Organizing semesters</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>With the studyplan, that was originally created by Julia Zamaitat, we had a good code base for our project and could extend it to an application with more features related to course planning and organization. At first, the studyplan was a <strong>tool to get a good overview of which courses you want to attend in which semesters as an IMI student</strong>. You can easily configure this plan for yourself by dragging and dropping the different courses into the desired semesters and even add new semesters. In case you forget what the default plan according to the study regulations looks like, you can simply check by choosing the &ldquo;Plan nach Studienordnung&rdquo; tab in the header of the site. Not only can you choose in which order you want to attend your courses, <strong>you also get a detailed overview of each one of them, which shows you the course content, requirements, desired outcome and more</strong>. You can even choose wether you have already registered or even passed them, which then shows you these specific courses in a different color in your studyplan.</div></section><figure><img src=/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/studyplan.png alt></figure></p></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
