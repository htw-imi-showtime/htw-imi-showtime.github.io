In the Original Vibro you had to separate keywords by using a semicolon and the Keyword Search itself was really small. In our new version we implemented chips that can individually be deleted and auto-suggestions to make it more easy for the user to search for Keywords.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b1/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b1/process/</guid><description>Development Our starting point was an already existing program which we wanted to improve. By both testing the program ourselves to understand and get into Vibro and analyzing the experts view, we evaluated the program to find common errors and see which features are more often used and essential for success. In the next step of our process we derived problems, prioritized them and discussed what we actually want to achieve.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b1/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b1/tech-stack/</guid><description>Tech Stack Com &amp;amp; Design Discord Discord is a voice and text communication program.
