While we did have the freedom to come up with any kind of vr game we wanted, we did stick with the idea of a fitness game.
In one of our first meetings we tasked everyone to come up with at least one game concept. All ideas were written down in a shared Google Docs document.
For our next meeting we had 8 ideas which we then discussed thoroughly and made improvements to. Finally each of us ranked all ideas from most to least favorite.
We mostly agreed on our rankings and decided to incorporate our three favorite concepts into one. The result was a game that involves boxing, drawing symbols and imitating poses.</div></section><p><section><h3>The Development Process</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>Any potential new features were discussed in team meetings and then added to the ‘Ideas’ list of our trello board.
Once we agreed that the new feature was something we wanted in our project we moved it to our ‘Backlog’ list on the trello board.
We then decided on its importance and urgency and labeled the trello card accordingly. If we thought this task was suited for one team member specifically
or somebody expressed interest in doing the task we assigned them to it. Some tasks were not immediately assigned and therefore left open for those who had
finished their tasks and were free and able to do them. It was then up to the assigned members to move the card to the ‘In Process’ list when they started working
on the task and to open a corresponding Git branch. If the corresponding team members thought that the task was done sufficiently, they opened a pull request on GitHub
and assigned other team members to review and test the branch. The trello card was then moved to the ‘Review & Testing’ list. Only if the group agreed that the task was
finished and all merge conflicts were resolved, was the branch merged into the main branch and the trello card was dragged into the ‘Done’ list.
During the semester we created two prototypes of the game where we integrated all finished features into a playable version of the game. We used these prototypes
to show our progress to our supervisor and to thoroughly test the game as a whole.</div></section><figure><img src=/ws20/bachelor/b3-a-spirit-tale/process.PNG alt="Our Trello Board"><figcaption>Our Trello Board</figcaption></figure></p><p><section><h3>Code Review</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>While working with GitHub, we chose a git workflow in which we had to create a new branch for every new feature that we wanted to implement into the game.
That way, after we were done working on it, we could create a pull request and choose one or more reviewers to have a look at our work.
This allowed us multiple times to avoid adding something to our main branch, that might break it. One such instance would be,
when someone created a pull request for a branch based on a rather old main version, which would then lead to having some of the newer features being overwritten once merged.
Once that was the case, the person had to either merge the newer main version into the feature branch and do some fixes, and if that didn’t work,
then they had to create a new branch, based on the current main, and move the changes over from the old feature branch.</div></section><script type=application/javascript src=https://gist.github.com/proehr/df0962ef67f3053d0c4f9cfc9c37025b.js></script></p><section><h3>Obstacles</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>Most of our problems consisted of misunderstandings when it came to the realisation of certain tasks, due to some language barriers.
As a result we had problems with the distribution of tasks because some members had little to do while waiting on others to finish their tasks.
But we made an effort to overcome these difficulties in the process of this project by improving our communication and trying to discuss any questions right from the beginning.
Part of this process of working on our difficulties was a retrospective that we held in the middle of the semester.
This was a good way to identify the strengths and weaknesses of our teamwork and how to proceed for the rest of our project.</div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
