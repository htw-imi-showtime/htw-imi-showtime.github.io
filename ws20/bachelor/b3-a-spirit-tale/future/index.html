Most of the ideas were about adding more variety to the features that were already implemented in the game, such as creating more maps:</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>having the player float on a galleon on top of an ocean, with the enemies closing in on ghost ships</li><li>a Sci-Fi city map with flying cars, robots etc.</li><li>an Atlantis map, that is to say an underwater map ancient Greek styled city
Another one was, to improve on or create new enemy types, such as:</li><li>a “Slashing” enemy, where the player has swords or axes in his hands, and the enemy has differently colored lines drawn on his body, which the player has to slash/ trace with his weapon(s).</li><li>an enemy type, which battling style/system is entirely distance based. In which the player has a bow/crossbow or other weapon type, which he has to use to hit one or multiple targets on the enemy, while the later keeps moving constantly.</li><li>to give the “Posing” enemies a speed mode, in which it displays a certain number of poses at a rather fast pace, after which the player has to replicate them from memory.</li><li>to add a lot more symbols for the player to draw on, to have more variety.</li></ul><p>Apart from those, we had a couple of “crazier” ideas along the way of making a multiplayer mode, where the players are encircled by enemies coming from all sides. Or to make the game moddable, but that seemed like a whole new challenge we weren’t up to yet.</p></div></section><section><h3>Hardware Upgrade</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>During our Development, there were times at which we had a shortage of VR headsets or had reached a “performance cap”, meaning we couldn’t add more to / had to remove things from a game scene due to the hardware limitations of the Oculus Quest. So, switching to an increased amount of VR headsets with higher performance, such as the Oculus Rift S or the HTC Vive, would be good for the further development of our game.</div></section><section><h3>The Team</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>During our time working on the project, we learned a lot. We were all able to improve our skills when it comes to using Git, planning our time management and operating autonomously as a group</div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
