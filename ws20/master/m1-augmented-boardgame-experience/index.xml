The first thing we did was to collect all the games that we know and that we could imagine in augmented form. For each game, we wrote down ideas on how we could digitally enrich the respective game. Then we presented the games and the corresponding ideas in the team.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/tech-stack/</guid><description>Technologies What Technology did we use? We used the cloud application platform Heroku to deploy our servers. In the backend we used the Django web framework with Python and in the frontend we used the NUXTJS web framework with JavaScript via Vue with the tailwind CSS framework. For the database, we chose the object-relational database system PostgreSQL. This is supported by Django as well as by Heroku.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/future/</guid><description>Some intro text without heading.
