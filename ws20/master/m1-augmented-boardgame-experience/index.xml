Server: Open the browser on your computer, laptop or SmartTV and visit http://themole.ml. Click on &amp;ldquo;Create game&amp;rdquo; to start a new game session. Now you can see the game lobby and the players that have joined it. If all players are present, click on &amp;ldquo;Start game&amp;rdquo;. Players: If the game lobby is open on your computer, laptop or SmartTV, you can enter it.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/process/</guid><description>Game Idea For brainstorming and elaboration we used a Miro board to share our ideas in the team.
The first thing we did was to collect all the games that we know and that we could imagine in augmented form. For each game, we wrote down ideas on how we could digitally enrich the respective game. Then we presented the games and the corresponding ideas in the team.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/tech-stack/</guid><description>Technologies What Technology did we use? In the following, all important technologies used in our project are indicated. For each technology, the logo, name and general function are presented. This should help you to better understand the graphic of the software architecture in the next paragraph. Architecture The following graphic describes the software architecture of the game &amp;ldquo;The Mole&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/future/</guid><description>Accessibility Due to the time constraints of this project, our first and foremost goal was to create a working prototype to present at the end of the semester.
One of the most important next steps, now that we achieved that goal, is to make sure the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are followed. While some features of the game offer great opportunities, e.g. the logged history of each game for which we could add an audio track for the visually impared, for others we will need the option to disable them if needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
