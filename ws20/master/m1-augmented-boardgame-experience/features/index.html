The <strong>murderer</strong> knows that you are investigating him. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s on your tail. Keep an eye on him to avoid getting caught. All players are in the <strong>Scotland Yard detective team</strong>. You must find all the necessary evidence to arrest the murderer. However, one of you is a mole. Watch out who you can trust. The <strong>mole</strong> can hinder you during the investigation.</p><p><strong>The Mission</strong></p><p>At the start of the game, players are randomly assigned different clues. There are five categories, each containing three clues. Your mission is to <strong>verify four categories</strong>. But be careful, categories verified by the mole is considered destroyed in the end! In summary, the game is about finding clues, sharing it with other players, verifying the categories and <strong>bringing the evidence to Scotland Yard</strong> before the murderer can catch up with you!</p></div></section><section><h3>The Map</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>Once the game is started, a map and other game-related information should appear on your computer, laptop or SmartTV. There are <strong>four map sections in total, each with 20 fields</strong>. The fields are connected to each other and show the path you have to complete. When you reach the end of a map, you&rsquo;ll automatically move on to the next section, provided it&rsquo;s not the last one.</p><p>On the board game map there are <strong>three types of fields</strong> &ldquo;normal field&rdquo; (white), &ldquo;occasion field&rdquo; (grey) and &ldquo;minigame field&rdquo; (blue). In an <strong>&ldquo;occasion field&rdquo;</strong>, the player must choose one from two occasions. There are five occasions in total, three of which are positive and two negative. The <strong>&ldquo;minigame field&rdquo;</strong> is always located at a shortcut. In the investigator team a minigame is played (so far pantomime) and if the word is guessed correctly by the whole team, the team is allowed to take the shortcut. On a <strong>&ldquo;normal field&rdquo;</strong> nothing happens.</p></div></section><figure><img src=/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/maps.png alt="The Map"><figcaption>The four map sections</figcaption></figure><section><h3>Game Board Description</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>On the upper left half of the computer, laptop or SmartTV screen there is a reminder of <strong>your mission</strong>.</p><p>Below that is a list of <strong>your clues</strong> that can be found and verified. Once a proof is verified, the color of the proof changes and the name of the player who verified the proof appears.</p><p>On the lower left half <strong>your history</strong> is displayed, which documents the events of the game board. If you have forgotten something, you can read the last moves and other important information again.</p><p>On the upper right half there is the <strong>room code</strong> and <strong>five buttons</strong>.</p><ul><li>The first button with the info icon gives the possibility to view the <strong>game rules</strong>.</li><li>The second button shows the <strong>card legend</strong>.</li><li>The third button can be used to turn the <strong>background music</strong> on and off. The music is meant to support the gaming experience. Since the story of &ldquo;The Mole&rdquo; is about solving murder cases in the late 19th and early 20th century, the music was chosen to be mystical and dark. As soon as the murderer gets dangerously close to the team, the music becomes more dramatic.</li><li>The fourth button <strong>changes the language</strong>. English and German language are supported.</li><li>The fifth button can be used to <strong>end the game</strong> (prematurely).</li></ul><p>The bottom bar shows the <strong>player order</strong>. The player marked in white is always the one whose turn it is. You can also see your player number here.</p></div></section><figure><img src=/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/game_board.png alt="Game board"><figcaption>The screen with the map and other game-related information</figcaption></figure><section><h3>Smartphone Navigation</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>Players take their turn one after the other. The following options are available to you <strong>while waiting for your turn</strong>:</p><p><strong>View role:</strong> Here you can see your role. If you are the mole, then keep it secret and do not stand out.</p><p>Under the button <strong>&ldquo;Show Clues&rdquo;</strong> you can see all your clues. For each category there are three correct clues that you have to find. If you have found all the clues of a category, you can verify them under &ldquo;Check proof&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>_</strong></p><p><strong>When it is your turn</strong>, you will see a selection menu. Here you can choose between four options.</p><p><strong>Roll the dice:</strong> To advance on the map you can roll the dice and confirm the corresponding steps. For this you need a dice and a dice board. The game tells you how to roll the dice. If nothing special is shown to you, you roll the dice <strong>normally</strong> and enter the rolled number in the smartphone. If you see <strong>hinder/easy</strong> dice instead, you have to read exactly what to do. In both variants you have to use the dice board and try to hit the center. Then enter the area you rolled on your smartphone.</p><p><strong>Search for clues:</strong> One way to get clues is to look for clues on your turn. Here you roll the dice and if you roll a for, five or six, you will find a clue. If successful, confirm this on your smartphone.</p><p><strong>Share clue:</strong> Here you can share clues with other players to verify evidence faster. But be careful, don&rsquo;t always give your clues to the same person, because it could be the mole that makes your clues useless.</p><p><strong>Checking proofs:</strong> If you have all three clues of a category, you can secure a proof here. Remember, by the end of the game your team must have verified four proofs.</p><p>If you have new messages or other important information, you will be notified by a popup window on your smartphone.</p></div></section><figure><img src=/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/waiting_options_arrows.png alt="Waiting options"><figcaption>The middle image shows the screen with the two available actions, which appears while you are waiting for your next move.
