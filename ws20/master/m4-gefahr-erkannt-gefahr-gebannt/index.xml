When entering the virtual workshop the players receive the task to craft a dice. This requires interaction with cutting machines like the hand lever or the guillotine shears as well as the bench drill to perforate the metal workpieces. To set the final product together, a glue gun needs to be used.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/process/</guid><description>Starting off We started this project without any prior experience in the field of occupational safety measures and how they are taught. As the need was brought to us in the context of a larger research project, we scheduled Zoom meetings with educational partners from AVT and bfw. They invited us to visit their workshops in order to gather enough information about the machines being used as well as the potential injuries.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/tech-stack/</guid><description>Development Our prototype was developed in Unity version 2019.4.12f1 and the VRTK version 3.3. We chose these core tools as the group members already had experience developing with them and could apply past knowledge while eliminating learning time. Furthermore, one group member had previously developed scripts for procedural mesh splitting, which became one of the core functions in our program. Modeling Various programs were used for modeling but Blender version 2.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/future/</guid><description>Our Future Plans Our team is very focused to keep working on our project in this coming semester.
As far as we have come now it gives us a very good foundation to come forward with our work in our VR application. We hope we can make it even better for users and maybe even provide it for other work fields. One field, which was especially asked for, would e.</description></item></channel></rss>
