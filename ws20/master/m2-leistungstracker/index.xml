It provides the following features to athletic teams and organizations:
Assessments We have two types of assessments:
Daily assessments are answered everyday in the morning. The questions range from the athlete&amp;rsquo;s state of mind to his or her body condition Session assessments are answered right after a training or match has taken place. The athletes give their personal view about the intensity of the session and provide the time that they were involved.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/process/</guid><description>The development process Throughout the duration of the project, we worked in a &amp;lsquo;Scrum-ban&amp;rsquo; mode. While we did plan our weekly sprints, we also worked very much on a &amp;lsquo;what-is-needed&amp;rsquo; basis. As we all had very different schedules, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have Dailies. Once a week we had a meeting that was Review and Sprint Planning in one. All code was in a shared Gitlab repository, where we checked in our code whenever a ticket was solved.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/tech-stack/</guid><description>React &amp;amp; Typescript Oh how beautiful our FE stack was. So gorgeous. Just amazing. Typescript is the best. Strict linting roles rule. NestJs &amp;amp; Typescript We used NestJS, a TypeScript framework for Node.js backend apps. This gave us a good modular structure and resulted in a clean architecture with a good testing setup. The Postgres database is accessed via TypeORM. All that hosting stuff - Docker Yes.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/future/</guid><description>We focused on building a technically stable and well-architected project that could and will be the foundation for an application that will be used by athletic corporations. Our architecture and tech stack are built so that new features can easily be added.
