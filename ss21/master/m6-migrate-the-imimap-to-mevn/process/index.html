To do this we repeated the following three steps:</p><ul><li>Talk to previous and current internship officers and the student assistants in the internship administration.</li><li>Understand and visualize the process.</li><li>Talk about the visualisations and make adjustments accordingly.</li></ul></div></section><section><h3>What to keep?</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>The next step was to evaluate the current IMI-Map and to decide what to keep and what to toss out. Due to the IMI-Map having an 8-year history there were a lot of relics of past ideas. Over the years there had also been a lot of additions to the IMI-Map and not a lot of cleaning up grown-out-of-hand models or unused features.</p><p>We ended up keeping all of the main features of the old IMI-Map. Amongst other things we tossed out old attempts on review processes and decided to redesign the models completely.</p></div></section><section><h3>What to add?</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>Now we needed to decide if we wanted to add anything. Talking to the internship officer and the student assistants gave us a lot of ideas what could be improved. We landed on:</p><ul><li>Implementing the handling of all the required PDFs using the IMI-Map to make the internship administration process more seamless.</li><li>Using <a href=https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html>Event Sourcing</a> to be able to keep an administration history of internships and also to de-clutter the internship model a lot because it didn&rsquo;t have to save the states of each of its components. Event Sourcing would take care of that.</li><li>Designing a new admin interface including quick actions and more to make the internship administration process faster and less tedious.</li><li>Redesigning the models that had grown and developed over the years to be huge.</li></ul></div></section><section><h3>Rewriting</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>After the concept was done we started implementing. We started working on frontend and backend separately. Simultaneously we worked on a deployment process and on a login strategy.</p><p>Once we had finished frontend and backend we connected them with an API and added Cypress tests.</p></div></section><section><h3>Obstacles</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>The biggest obstacle in this project was the concept and implementation of <a href=https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html>Event Sourcing</a>. We spent a lot of time defining which events we would need and how exactly they could be implemented to best depict the process ot the internship administration.</p><p>As cheesy as it sounds: We solved this obstacle using teamwork. After we could not solve this as individual team members we spent a lot of time together as a whole group discussing the events and their implementation until we landed on a version which we all thought was logical and also practical.</p></div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
