To increase the challenge and make the game more fun to play, a few first gamification features were implemented:</p><ul><li><strong>Timer</strong>: Each game is played against the clock, the objective is to achieve the target shape as fast as possible. This enables players of different games to compare their times and success later on.</li><li>Quick & <strong>easy</strong> new games: As soon as the target shape has been matched, the players can start the next round with a <strong>new shape</strong></li><li>Animation: The <strong>target shape is animated</strong> as soon as the players manage to reproduce it, to indicate that the game has been won</li></ul></div></section><figure><img src=/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/host-flow.svg alt="host user flow"></figure></p><section><h3>How does this work?</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>Three steps are implemented to display the positions of the players and the target figure.</p><ol><li>Distance Calculation</li><li>Position Determination</li><li>Shape Alignment</li></ol></div></section><section><h3>1. Distance Calculation</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>The first step is the <strong>distance calculation</strong> between the different players. This is done by using the <strong>bluetooth signal strength (RSSI)</strong>. The stronger the signal, the closer the devices are to each other. A well-known use-case of this solution is the Corona Warn App, for example. Each device has a different transmission power that can be determined experimentally. If the transmission power is known, the distance can be calculated as follows:</div></section><script src="https://gist.github.com/lenavollmer/8021bb0bc10247d222fce63e3c8f61ef.js?file=DistanceCalculation.kt"></script><section><h3>2. Position Estimation</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>After the distances between all players are known, the player positions can be calculated. We can only calculate relative positions from the distances. This means that the resulting triangle can be transformed by translation, rotation or reflection and would still match all the distances (congruence).</p><figure><img src=/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/distance-to-position-1.svg alt="Step 1 distances to positions"></figure><p>The input is a distance matrix that describes the lengths of the sides of the triangle on the right.</p><figure><img src=/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/distance-to-position-2.svg alt="Step 2 distances to positions"></figure><p>Player A is positioned at the origin of the coordinate system. Player B is positioned with the following assumptions:</p><ul><li>B shares the same y coordinate as A</li><li>B is to the right of A</li></ul><figure><img src=/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/distance-to-position-3.svg alt="Step 3 distances to positions"></figure><p>Finally, the angle alpha can be calculated using the law of cosines. This in turn can be used to determine the x and y position of player C.</p></div></section><section><h3>3. Shape Alignment</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p>As the calculated player positions are relative, they need to be aligned to the target shape. As soon as the players&rsquo; positions and the positions of the target shape have the same distances between them, the shapes have to lie perfectly on top of each other. This is done in three steps:</p><figure><img src=/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/step-1.svg alt="Step 1 Shape Alignment"></figure><p>At first the position of player A is always assigned to the &lsquo;first&rsquo; point of the target shape (Step 1).</p><figure><img src=/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/step-2-3.svg alt="Step 2 and 3 Shape Alignment"></figure><p>In Step 2 the player shape is rotated so that the corresponding sides of the target and the player shape are parallel.</p><p>Finally, both shapes are centered independently on the game screen.</p></div></section><section><h3>Bluetooth Connection & Sending of Data</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><p><strong>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)</strong> is the foundation of GeZuMi. Throughout the app, the connection relies on a <strong>broadcasting approach</strong> that avoids having to pair all devices with each other, which would make the connection unstable, and a <strong>client-server-communication</strong> between clients and the host of the game.</p><p>After joining a game, each player starts broadcasting <strong>Bluetooth packages</strong> that contain a <strong>game-specific identifier</strong> and some <strong>game data</strong> (rssi values, distances) to be processed by all other players. This enables each device to measure and calculate its distance to other players. It then sends a data package to the <strong>host device</strong> which <strong>collects, joins and corrects all the data</strong>. The host is responsible for <strong>computing a valid game state</strong> (i.e. the positions of all players) and providing consistent game data to the clients.</p><figure><img src=/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/bluetooth.gif alt="bluetooth network animation"></figure></div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
