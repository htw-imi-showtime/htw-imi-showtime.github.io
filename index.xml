All levels have been created and analysed by our team, to support different skills from coordination on the screen to simple mathematics and calculations. Our main menu leads the player to the level screen, which allows the player to choose between easy, normal and difficult graphs. Revisitors are able to see their finished levels in the level selection screen.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b5-berlin-for-future/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b5-berlin-for-future/features/</guid><description>The vision Our group was tasked by the Berlin Senate with creating two concepts to encourage climate conscious behaviour in students and young people alike. Consequently, this is not just a programming project we’re embarked on this semester.
Thus, our project does not only consist of features, but also of:
climate situation analysis target group, literature, market and app research survey and focus group interviews idea visualisation concept presentation for the Berlin Senate implementation Target group As specified by the Berlin Senate, we were to target students specifically.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/features/</guid><description>Start and Client Screen Start Screen To help players understand which of the &amp;lsquo;player-dots&amp;rsquo; they represent on the game screen and to enable hosts to consciously build teams, all users are asked to provide a player name on the start screen of the app (see first screen below).

This concept is inspired by the Akinator application. By traversing a dynamic tree the software automatically selects a series of questions and it also calculates the score of the user and determines his job, that will allow the artificial intelligence engine to guess as quickly as possible the most suitable professions for the user and determines the technical skills that the user has or not depending on the answers to the questions and gives an assessment.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m6-migrate-the-imimap-to-mevn/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m6-migrate-the-imimap-to-mevn/features/</guid><description>The Old IMI-Map The goal of this project was to rewrite the IMI-Map using a new Tech Stack. So we rewrote the app implementing all the features of the old IMI-Map:
Internship Search
Students can search the internship database of the IMI-Map to get inspiration for their own internship. Internship Postponements
Students can request a postponement of their internship using the IMI-Map.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m7-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt-teil-2/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m7-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt-teil-2/features/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;You want 33 percent of what&amp;rsquo;s already there, existing, 33 percent improved, and 33 percent brand-new in terms of mechanics&amp;rdquo; (Dennis Shirk, team producer at Firaxis, 2016)

Through templates and adding php code to each and every UI element on the site, non-programmer admins log in then use customizer to edit image, text, style, layout, hyperlink, adjust navigation, change site info and so on. This of course prolong the frontend development process, but in the long run, it&amp;rsquo;ll save the start-up resources to modify even something as small as a punctuation, and since UI maintaining becomes as easy as it gets, business owners could easily change content up on the Live site without the users seeing any of the changes before publishing them.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/features/</guid><description>Features List The features listed below are included in the augmented board game &amp;ldquo;The Mole&amp;rdquo;:

Deshalb lag unser Fokus am Anfang stark auf der Recherche zu diesem Thema, bevor wir begonnen haben Spieleideen zu sammeln.
Recherche Wir hatten uns bereits früh darauf geeinigt, dass das Spiel auf Smartphones ausgerichtet sein soll. Aus diesem Grund haben wir uns explizit angesehen, was es bereits für Spiele auf diesen Geräten gibt, die in unsere Thematik passen könnten.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b1-strollr-project/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b1-strollr-project/process/</guid><description>Idea The idea for our app originated out of a conversation with a local gardening project. It is an approach to a rather recent question: How do you make spending time in nature more appealing to children and adolescents who grew up on smartphones and other mobile devices?
Our supervisor, Prof. Dr. Lenz approached us with his initial idea for a mobile application which already laid out most of the core features that the final version of Strollr incorporates, like the ability to take photos and visualize walks with a map.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b3-dollar-game/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b3-dollar-game/process/</guid><description>Research Many questions were thrown into the pot upon our first meeting as a group. Since our game is based on graph theory, we needed to decide how we want to design it, what its general goals are and what programming languages and frameworks we want to use. Research and brainstorming was the order of the day. We dedicated our first weeks fully on the first, but very important decisions.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b5-berlin-for-future/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b5-berlin-for-future/process/</guid><description>Requirements Our project this semester “Berlin for Future” has been made together with the Senate of Berlin. The Senate has been looking for fresh and interesting ideas for making students more aware about climate change.
At our first meeting with the representative from the Senate we asked her about different aspects of the project (expectations, wishes, topic of interest). We found out about an idea of Klimasparbuch(climate savings book) for Berlin, a sustainable guide for the city, which has already been created for some regions in Germany.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m1-gezumi/process/</guid><description>Design Evolution At the beginning, all ideas were collected on a Miroboard from which the following mock-ups were then developed (see image below). Players would land on a starting screen where they could select whether they wanted to start a new game or join an existing one. Two variants for the game-setup screen were mocked (screen 2 and 3). One would allow the host to manually select the players for a game, while the other alternative would randomly create teams based on all available, current app users.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m2-something-unreal/_process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m2-something-unreal/_process/</guid><description>First things first general ideas collected Every project has a beginning and an end. Before we started doing anything, we were discussing possible ideas for a project. We had to do something with Unreal Engine 4, but the question was, what do we want to do? And how do we want to do it? Who wants to do what? In the beginning we had a lot of questions and we tried to hold all our ideas in a Miro board.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m3-find-it/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m3-find-it/process/</guid><description>Preparation Steps in the preparation phase This is the first IMI Showtime for some of our group members.

We generally knew what we had to do to reach our goal. Some questions still came up, that had to be answered first, before starting to code. We had to first decide on a framework we want to use.

To our surprise we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any product that was focusing on meetings the same way we do. We began thinking about our own experiences with meetings or even classes and what kind of tool could have been useful to evaluate them. We came up with a bunch of fancy features but narrowed it down to a core functionality at the end for our MVP:</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b3-a-spirit-tale/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b3-a-spirit-tale/process/</guid><description>Brainstorming This project was initially pitched to us as a VR audio fitness game for the Oculus Quest. While we did have the freedom to come up with any kind of VR game we wanted, we did stick with the idea of a fitness game. In one of our first meetings we tasked everyone to come up with at least one game concept. All ideas were written down in a shared Google Docs document.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b4-rematch-project/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b4-rematch-project/process/</guid><description>Research Benchmarking &amp;amp; Market Research Compared thoroughly the existing hiring platforms on the market and found out the common issues that users faced while using these platforms.

Whether it’s in a professional business setting, for an academic study, or just for casual private uses.

Development The technological foundation we continued working on is realized with the Unity (2019.4.12f1) game engine, expanded by the SteamVR (1.2.3) and the Virtual Reality Toolkit (3.3.0) plugins. For project setup and code versioning we used the same approved GitLab self-hosted solution as last semester.
In terms of the targeted hardware: there were internal discussions at the beginning of the semester about porting the application to a standalone, inside-out-tracking based platform like the Oculus Quest 2.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b1-kiss/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b1-kiss/tech-stack/</guid><description>Our tech stack Tech Stack Flutter™️ The first step of the journey was choosing a framework that meets our requirements.

Gamification Our product (in its current form) makes use of gamification, which remains a debated topic. As with all serious games, the selection and implementation of gamification elements must be carefully made and tested. If done wrongly, such mechanics can be demotivating and, in our case, even harmful, if too much focus is shifted from the actual lessons of workshop safety to the completion of game goals.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b1-kiss/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b1-kiss/future/</guid><description>So, what&amp;#39;s next?

While some features of the game offer great opportunities, e.g. the logged history of each game for which we could add an voice over for the visually impared, for others we will need the option to disable them if needed.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/future/</guid><description>We focused on building a technically stable and well-architected project that could and will be the foundation for an application that will be used by athletic corporations. Our architecture and tech stack are built so that new features can easily be added.

The timespan for this project was only sufficient to train the models for a proof of concept stage. With more time and hyperparameter adjustments the quality of the path predictions could be improved. More Concepts As part of our project we also came up with more concepts which have not yet been implemented.
The first is “step by step walking from both directions”.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/future/</guid><description>Our Future Plans Our team is proud of the progress achieved during this semester. We see it as a good foundation for future development.
Furthermore during our user tests we were able to verify what we already assumed: there is a strong request for VR applications to enrich current safety training lessons. User testing was also especially helpful to gather valuable feedback, which we used to generate even more ideas for improvement.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b2-easycontract/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b2-easycontract/future/</guid><description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? With the first version of easyContract, the work of StartRight will hopefully become easier very soon, but the already existing functions can be further optimized and adapted. Additional Features Completing role assignment through which access rights for the website are controlled. The linking of the calendar and the project overview is a useful extension for assigning notes to an appointment directly to a project.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b3-allmende/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b3-allmende/future/</guid><description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? Allmende has a huge potentional for the further grow. As the following step we see a development and writing a Rules of Conduct in order to moderate user-generated content. Moreover, Allmende is now accessible in a Webbrowser, the next step would be to make it available for mobile through the channels like Apple Store. Additional Features Like every development team working with a deadline we had to cut out some features that were planned at the beginning but had to be postponed.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b4-bessere-wahlpflichtkursbelegung/future/</guid><description>Extensions Our task was to make the elective course registration for IMI bachelor students easier. However, our final product can easily be extended, which will probably be done in a bachelor thesis.
All HTW students Since the studyplan can only help IMI bachelor students with their elective course registration and organization so far, the next step would be to make it usable for master students and someday all the other students as well.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b5-penny-pincher/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b5-penny-pincher/future/</guid><description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? For now we would like to keep working on this project privately and keep improving it! We have come far but there is still a lot that we would like to do.. Additional Features Social Media Hub There are some new features we would like to add in the future such as adding notifications for limited time offers and being able to choose between main and sub categories in browser.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b6-spiel-mich-und-ich-sage-dir-wer-du-bist/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/bachelor/b6-spiel-mich-und-ich-sage-dir-wer-du-bist/future/</guid><description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? Creating a whole game in such a short time span was no easy task. Basing that game on psychological research even less so. We are very excited to publish a fleshed out game, even if we had to cut some of the planned features short.
There are many ideas we could still expand on. But whether some of us might return to this game, or if we&amp;rsquo;ll all start new projects utilising the experience we gathered during this one, remains to be seen.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m4-lcvd/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m4-lcvd/future/</guid><description>Beyond the MVP To make patients of Long Covid feel even less alone, our app should also provide
a possibility for them to connect with others in the same situation to exchange experiences a way to document experiences in their own words, like a blog, that they can share with others who are not affected Inputting a vaccination certificate or PCR test result via QR code directly into the app could help to avoid errors and make the app even easier to use.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m6-haptic-globe/_future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m6-haptic-globe/_future/</guid><description>Standalone VR Even though the Oculus Quest theoretically could offer hand tracking and a controller at the same time, they currently do not support this via their framework. This forced us to use the Leap Motion for hand tracking which is furthermore tying us to desktop VR. We hope they will open up this functionality in the future, because it would be more portable as a Quest app.</description></item><item><title>Our Focus</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/our-focus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/our-focus/</guid><description>Whatever you need, whenever you need it We made a huge progress in defining our final product vision when we asked ourselves what the specific use cases for our product were. We wanted to provide a tool that gives you the freedom to do what you need to do at the specific moment to make your group-project work, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t overwhelm you with fancy features that you most likely won&amp;rsquo;t make any use of.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m2-a-better-spotify/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m2-a-better-spotify/tech-stack/</guid><description>Typescript Typescript Typescript is the programming language that was used in both front- and backend.

Step 1 Sam enters “Lion“ into the Keyword Search.
Step 2 He starts looking in the Result Map, but isn‘t satisfied with the results there so he thinks painting the lion would help. Sam goes to the Painting-Tool and starts drawing the lion. After he is done, he notes that the drawing didn‘t help him, so he hits UNDO.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m2-a-better-spotify/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws21/master/m2-a-better-spotify/future/</guid><description>Overview As Better Spotify is an application that was created solely to provide an improved version of an already existing streaming platform, the possible extensions to it are truly endless. To give a short idea of what had been planned by the team but discarded due to the time restrictions, only a selected few of the 30+ ideas in the backlog will be explained.

During the last few months we were able to create a full design library with custom components that allows future designers to enter the project and quickly start designing new components. This was accomplished by keeping the entire figma document clearly and well structured. We were also able to deliver a high-fidelity prototype dashboard that already covers a full basic user flow within a framework that easily allows future developers to add more functionality without compromising for scalability or performance.</description></item><item><title>Team</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m2-something-unreal/_team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m2-something-unreal/_team/</guid><description>The Team We are a team of various personalities, ages, experience and knowledge. We all came together to work on the project Something Unreal. Despite diversity, there is one thing that unites us all - our love for video games and new technologies.
