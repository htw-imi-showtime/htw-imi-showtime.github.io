So we rewrote the app implementing all the features of the old IMI-Map:
Internship Search
Students can search the internship database of the IMI-Map to get inspiration for their own internship. Internship Postponements
Students can request a postponement of their internship using the IMI-Map. These requests can then be processed and accepted or denied by the internship officer using the IMI-Map as well.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b1-kiss/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/bachelor/b1-kiss/features/</guid><description>Feature set Offline Data Our app is completely offline compatible We have over 30.000 ingredients stored in our data set.

This of course prolong the frontend development process, but in the long run, it&amp;rsquo;ll save the start-up resources to modify even something as small as a punctuation, and since UI maintaining becomes as easy as it gets, business owners could easily change content up on the Live site without the users seeing any of the changes before publishing them.</description></item><item><title>Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m1-augmented-boardgame-experience/features/</guid><description>Features List The features listed below are included in the augmented board game &amp;ldquo;The Mole&amp;rdquo;:

Deshalb lag unser Fokus am Anfang stark auf der Recherche zu diesem Thema, bevor wir begonnen haben Spieleideen zu sammeln.
Recherche Wir hatten uns bereits früh darauf geeinigt, dass das Spiel auf Smartphones ausgerichtet sein soll. Aus diesem Grund haben wir uns explizit angesehen, was es bereits für Spiele auf diesen Geräten gibt, die in unsere Thematik passen könnten.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b0-template-project/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b0-template-project/process/</guid><description>First steps Our goal was clear.

It is an approach to a rather recent question: How do you make spending time in nature more appealing to children and adolescents who grew up on smartphones and other mobile devices?

All code was located in a shared Gitlab repository, where we checked in our code whenever a ticket was solved.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m3-deep-3d-pathfinding/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m3-deep-3d-pathfinding/process/</guid><description>Research Due to the lack of machine learning experience we started our project by researching how machine learning works, what different kinds of concepts exist and which of them are relevant for our path finding problem.

While some features of the game offer great opportunities, e.g. the logged history of each game for which we could add an voice over for the visually impared, for others we will need the option to disable them if needed.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m2-leistungstracker/future/</guid><description>We focused on building a technically stable and well-architected project that could and will be the foundation for an application that will be used by athletic corporations.

The timespan for this project was only sufficient to train the models for a proof of concept stage. With more time and hyperparameter adjustments the quality of the path predictions could be improved. More Concepts As part of our project we also came up with more concepts which have not yet been implemented.
The first is “step by step walking from both directions”.</description></item><item><title>Future</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/future/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws20/master/m4-gefahr-erkannt-gefahr-gebannt/future/</guid><description>Our Future Plans Our team is proud of the progress achieved during this semester. We see it as a good foundation for future development.
Furthermore during our user tests we were able to verify what we already assumed: there is a strong request for VR applications to enrich current safety training lessons. User testing was also especially helpful to gather valuable feedback, which we used to generate even more ideas for improvement.</description></item><item><title>Our Focus</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/our-focus/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/our-focus/</guid><description>Whatever you need, whenever you need it We made a huge progress in defining our final product vision when we asked ourselves what the specific use cases for our product were. We wanted to provide a tool that gives you the freedom to do what you need to do at the specific moment to make your group-project work, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t overwhelm you with fancy features that you most likely won&amp;rsquo;t make any use of.</description></item><item><title>Team</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m2-something-unreal/_team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/master/m2-something-unreal/_team/</guid><description>The Team We are a team of various personalities, ages, experiences and knowledge. We all came together to work on the project Something Unreal. Despite diversity, there is one thing that unites us all - our love for video games and new technologies.
At the beginning, everyone shared their preferences on what they would like to contribute to the project. Some wanted to gain new experiences, while others wanted to do what they are good at.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/tech-stack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/tech-stack/</guid><description>Node.js &amp;amp; Socket.io We made use of Node.js, which is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime and designed to build scalable network applications. Together with Socket.io, which enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication, we had the perfect base for building our application. MongoDB We decided to work with MongoDb, which is a document-oriented database system, classified as a NoSQL database program.</description></item><item><title>Videos</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b1-hexarcade/videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b1-hexarcade/videos/</guid><description> Präsentation Gameplay Editor</description></item><item><title>Future Features</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/future-features/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/future-features/</guid><description>So, what&amp;#39;s next? If we have had more time, we probably would have come up with so much more ideas of what to integrate in The Missing Tool. And we already had some ideas that we would like to be realized in the future – either by us or some other students who will get a chance to work on the tool. Audiochat We want to give our users the opportunity to chat via audio, as an addition to the chat that is already present.</description></item><item><title>Screenshots</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b1-hexarcade/gallery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b1-hexarcade/gallery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About the project</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/master/m6-visense/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/master/m6-visense/about/</guid><description> Project Goals web application for visualization of IoT sensor data in building models anomaly detection analysis of measured values by calculating gradients and defining limit values for each sensor timeline chronological monitoring and comparison of sensor data mesh coloring colored representation of the measured values on sensor meshes in the 3D model sensor meshes documentation of sensor locations in the 3D model Project Structure</description></item><item><title>App gallery</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/master/m1-unhooked/gallery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/master/m1-unhooked/gallery/</guid><description> Main screen of our App Onboarding screen Unit screen Unit multiple choice quiz screen Unit single choice quiz screen Unit fill the blank quiz screen Unit feedback screen Knowledgebase screen Knowledgebase unit screen Profile screen Archievement screen Login screen</description></item><item><title>Behind the Scenes</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b3-private-investors/behind-the-scenes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b3-private-investors/behind-the-scenes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Concept gallery</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/master/m1-unhooked/concept/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/master/m1-unhooked/concept/</guid><description> Unhooked wireframe concept</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/contact/</guid><description>The IMIxShowtime is a showcase of the term-long practical projects in the International Media and Computing Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and Master&amp;rsquo;s programs.

Es zeigt einem, wie gut man Farben kombinieren kann, wie man unterschiedlichen Formen fühlt, wie man Objekte auf der Seite zusammenstellen kann usw. Dies ist ein kreativer Prozess, an dem jeder teilnehmen kann, unabhängig davon, welches Wissen er besitzt. Er verbindet und gibt viel zum Nachdenken.
Bei der Entwicklung unseres ersten Designs waren wir kaum beschränkt, sodass wir unserer Kreativität freien Lauf lassen konnten.</description></item><item><title>Entwicklung</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b4-manifesto/entwicklung/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b4-manifesto/entwicklung/</guid><description> Entwicklung Die Implementierung der technischen Pipeline ist grob in 3 Stufen unterteilt.

Hier ist vorallem erst einmal die Aufteilung in Verschiedene Schritte wichtig gewesen um die verschiedenen Zustände definieren zu können. Die Definiton der Fläche ist ein Startpunkt und funktioniert darüber hinaus als Interaktionsmöglichkeit in sich mit einer weiteren Fläche als Spielort.
Unterteilt wird in 4 verschiedene Grundphasen. Es gibt immer mindestens zwei Flächen, die in die Interaktion mit einfließen.</description></item><item><title>Pictures</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b2-vrforfuture/pictures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b2-vrforfuture/pictures/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/privacy-policy/</guid><description>Es gilt die Datenschutzerklärung der HTW Berlin.

Es wurde ursprünglich in Flutter (Dart) geschrieben, also mussten wir nicht die Programmiersprache auswählen, in der wir unsere App schreiben würden, als wir anfingen, daran zu arbeiten. Flutter ist eine sehr einfaches, klares und angenehmes Open-Source UI-Entwicklungs-Kit von Google, die für jeden Anfänger, der sich für die Entwicklung von Cross-Plattform-Apps interessiert, verständlich ist. Alle Komponenten in Flutter sind widgets, aus denen wir unsere App Stück für Stück zusammenstellen.</description></item><item><title>Video</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b4-energy-matters/video/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b4-energy-matters/video/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Video</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b4-manifesto/video/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss21/bachelor/b4-manifesto/video/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Videos</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b2-vrforfuture/videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b2-vrforfuture/videos/</guid><description> Preview Presentation</description></item><item><title>Videos</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b3-private-investors/videos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ss20/bachelor/b3-private-investors/videos/</guid><description> Wie das Projekt entstanden ist?
