We had many ideas in mind, from designing little telepresence games like &ldquo;Who Am I?&rdquo;, a flexible poll tool up to an online-tutoring platform for students.</p><br><figure><img src=/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/brainstorming.png alt=brainstorming width=600><figcaption>our brainstorming process</figcaption></figure><br><p>As interesting as all of those ideas would have been, the spark has not yet jumped. We had to do another round and really ask ourselves – and our supervisor Barne – what it really is that we want to achieve.</p><h3 id=question-what-is-possible>Question: What is possible?</h3><p>Before diving deeper into one particular vision, we explored our technical options based on our knowledge and the time we had available for adapting to new technologies. We explored working with Webstorm, integration of video conference tools like Jitsi or BigBlueButton, and using WebGL for animations of user avatars. We also dived into the topic of serverless communication, because we wanted our final product to be as lightweight as possible.</p><h3 id=conclusion-not-everything-is>Conclusion: Not everything is.</h3><p>After exploring our options we were a bit disillusioned about the results we found – working with third-party video conference tools was out of our scope because taking the time to work ourselves through the available source code would already have taken most of our available time. Serverless communication also was not the right use-case for our ideas we came up with so far. So really, what&rsquo; left?</p><h3 id=our-final-vision>Our final vision</h3><p>Do you want to know, how we defined our final product vision considering all technological constraints? Then read on:
