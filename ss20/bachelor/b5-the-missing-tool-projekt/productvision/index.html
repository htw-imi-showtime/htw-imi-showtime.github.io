What differenciates us from already existing collaboration tools is our focus on fast working processes without the need of getting familiar with yet another online-tool and the need of handling just one more login for your university accounts. Plus: Finding sub-groups is easier than ever!
We know that the everyday life of a student is busy – being students ourselves helped us understand that we are the ones responsible for not making it busier.</p><h3 id=enough-blah-blah-we-want-to-see-results>Enough blah blah, we want to see results!</h3><p>To define the MVP we created a user story map that defines which features we wanted to implement and which were not our top-priority. This map is extendible and was used as a rough reference to guide us through our sprints:</p><figure><img src=/ss20/bachelor/b5-the-missing-tool-projekt/userStoryMap.jpg alt=story_map><figcaption>our user story map</figcaption></figure><p>Do you want to get a first impression of what you can do on our tool?
