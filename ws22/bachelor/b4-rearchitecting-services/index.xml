the infrastructure part (tells what ressources to deploy to AWS) the business logic part (the code itself that runs in the Lambda) The CDK template is generic: API Gateway receives traffic (we get some data about favorite colors, snacks and movies with different data types) and then it goes to a Lambda function. No matter if the incoming data is valid or not valid it will be transformed and saved into S3 bucket as a recap that we have received, but if the validation actually was successful it would be sent to the SQS Queue.</description></item><item><title>Process</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws22/bachelor/b4-rearchitecting-services/process/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws22/bachelor/b4-rearchitecting-services/process/</guid><description>Process The initial idea was to build based on the CDK template payload modification processing which then runs in production and can prove that the solution is cheaper than the old server solution which is currently used at Idealo. The Lambda function was supposed to do some payload validation and maybe some signature verification (cryptography related).
There were some reasons why it did not happen:
Idealo decided to discontinue the Direktkauf feature, the scope was changed, so it was not really applicable anymore Our project management: we had a lot to learn in the beginning, we had no knowledge of AWS and CDK.</description></item><item><title>Tech Stack</title><link>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws22/bachelor/b4-rearchitecting-services/techstack/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ws22/bachelor/b4-rearchitecting-services/techstack/</guid><description> Tech Stack Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
