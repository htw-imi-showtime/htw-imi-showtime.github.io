It is a tool to join or organize book clubs, to thoroughly plan the discussions and to guide through them. This enhances the organizational aspects of every book club. It even provides a Live Discussion feature, which supports the moderator of the discussion to stay on time and on schedule. By that it enables all participants to be part of planned, structured and in-depth discussions.</p><h2 id=logo-of-blubble>Logo of Blubble</h2><figure><img src=/ws22/bachelor/b6-book-reading-club-applikation/Bookclub_Logo_300ppi.png alt="The Logo of our app Blubble"></figure><section><h3>Our Goal</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>A clear structure for useful and clear organized discussions for better learning for students, artists and business teams.

We met twice a week, Thursdays in the Diva-E office at Berlin Südkreuz and Mondays online via Zoom. There we presented and discussed things we were working on, identified problems and distributed tasks. We also reviewed the past week and the dynamic of the group.
We assigned the work according to our desires, experiences and expertise, which lead to the following constellation:</p><ul><li>Audrey: Design</li><li>Colin: Frontend / Backend</li><li>Lana: Design / Frontend</li><li>Leander: Backend</li><li>Jonas: Project Management</li><li>Marina: Frontend / Backend</li><li>Sönke: Frontend</li></ul><p>Of course we helped each other out in all fields when there was the need. For organizing and planning our weekly sprints, we used Trello to keep track of the tasks and their distributions. Slack and WhatsApp were our main communication channels and Zoom or Teams were used for meetings as well as partner or group work.
Additionally we heavily relied on Miro during the planning and conception stage, for gathering ideas and creating wireframes. Figma was used to polish the wireframes and to create a final design.</p></div></section><section><h3>Tech Stack</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content><ul><li>Ionic React</li><li>Capacitor</li><li>Open Library</li><li>Docker</li><li>Digital Ocean</li><li>Firebase DB</li></ul></div></section><section><h3>Future</h3><div class=spacer></div><div class=content>In the future we plan to enhance the book club experience for our users even more. With the next big update it will be possible for every participant of a Live Discussion to see the assigned notes to every subchapter that the group is currently discussing about on screen. It will also be possible to change the moderator of a discussion so that no planned discussion will be missed out. Additionally we plan to enhance our user experience by adding push-notifications for changes made on upcoming discussions and by implementing the functionality to change user account data such as user email and password.</div></section></main><footer><section><a href=https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/ class=animate-trigger><strong>IMI<span class=light>⨯</span><span class=animate>ST</span></strong>
