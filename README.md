# Showtime Website Staging & Preview

Staging has been split to:

BK 31.7.2023: I've removed the project-archive from staging and preview as it slows down the deployment significally. tryout still has the archive (see below)
## [Staging](https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/staging/) - including drafts, without project-archive

[https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/staging/](https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/staging/)

## [Preview](https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/preview/) - without drafts (like production), but without project-archive

[https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/preview/](https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/preview/)

## [Tryout](https://htw-imi-showtime.github.io/tryout/) - with drafts, with project-archive
